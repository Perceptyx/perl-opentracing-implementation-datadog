=head1 NAME

OpenTracing::Implementation::DataDog::ID - 64bit integers for DataDog

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use OpenTracing::Implementation::DataDog::ID qw/random_datadog_id/;
    
    my $data_struct = {
        some_id => random_datadog_id();
    };

and later:

    print $data_struct->{some_id}->TO_JSON;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package ensures nice 64bit integers, as expected by DataDog. However, some
architectures do not support 64bit ints, and only go for 4 bytes.

Under the hood, this is just a nice abstract way to deal with a C<Math::BigInt>.

our $VERSION = 'v0.46.0';


use parent 'Math::BigInt';
use Math::BigInt::Random::OO;
#
# $random
#
# our internal BigInt::Random generator, we only instantiate once
#
my $random = Math::BigInt::Random::OO->new( length_bin => 63 );

use Exporter qw/import/;

our @EXPORT_OK = qw/random_datadog_id/;

hereâ€™s what you need to know about how span IDs and trace IDs are generated and
accepted by Datadog tracing libraries.
